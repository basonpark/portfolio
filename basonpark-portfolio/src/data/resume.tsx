  summary:
    "This specimen was born in Japan and raised in South Korea. He studied computer science in college, but he forgot most of the algorithms when he joined the Korean military. To escape the monotony, he applied to become a peacekeeper in South Sudan. The sudden transition from coffee chats and cocktail parties in NYC to mediating tribal conflict in the world's poorest country induced in him a mild domain expansion. After graduating, he decided to try out a few more cultures, particularly those in South America and Europe. His current focus is building AI tools that help us discover hidden thought patterns and make better decisions.",
